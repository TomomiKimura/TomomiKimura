### Hi, I'm Tomomi 👋👩🏻‍💻

I started my journey in software development 2 years ago. Through a series of online courses, self-studying and the help of a private tutor, I've gotten a grasp of modern frontend technologies. I have a background in teaching and management, and can speak both English and Japanese. I'm a passionate person that likes challenges and is always looking for ways to work together with other people to improve other people's lives.
